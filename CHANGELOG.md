# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.3.3] - 2026-03-28

### Documentation

- **Companion files populated** — all 28 companion files (`context.md` and `tasks.md`) across 14 modules now contain real content: architectural decisions, key files, implementation status, open tasks, known gaps, and completed work (#58).

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- **`action.yml` YAML parse fix** — quoted `${{ github.token }}` default value to prevent YAML stream parse errors when external repos use the action (#56).
- **`spec:check` in CI** — added spec validation to the CI pipeline so spec drift is caught automatically (#54).

### Added

- **`manifest.spec.md`** — spec for the manifest module, achieving **100% file coverage** across all 23 source files (#55).
- **Config spec update** — added `manifest` to config's `depends_on` for accurate cross-module references.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **`specsync-registry.toml`** — published module registry for cross-project spec resolution. Other projects can now verify refs to `CorvidLabs/spec-sync@<module>` via `resolve --remote`.

### Documentation

- **New docs page: Cross-Project References** — dedicated guide covering `owner/repo@module` syntax, registry publishing, remote verification, and CI usage.
- **CLI Reference** — added missing commands: `add-spec`, `init-registry`, `resolve`, `hooks`. Added `--format` flag documentation.
- **Spec Format** — documented cross-project ref syntax in `depends_on` field.
- **Quick Start** — added `add-spec`, `resolve`, `init-registry`, and `hooks` commands.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- **`--format markdown` output** — `check` and `diff` commands now accept `--format markdown` to produce clean, human-readable Markdown tables instead of plain text or JSON. Useful for pasting into PRs, docs, or chat.
- **SHA256 release checksums** — release workflow now generates and publishes SHA256 checksums for all release binaries, improving supply chain verification.

### Changed

- Rolled up all v2.2.1 changes (manifest-aware modules, export granularity, language templates, robustness fixes) into this release.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-03-25 (unreleased — rolled into 2.3.0)

### Added

- **Manifest-aware module detection** — parses `Package.swift`, `Cargo.toml`, `build.gradle.kts`, `package.json`, `pubspec.yaml`, `go.mod`, and `pyproject.toml` to auto-discover targets and source paths instead of just scanning directories.
- **Export granularity control** — `"exportLevel": "type"` in `specsync.json` limits exports to top-level type declarations (class/struct/enum/protocol) instead of listing every member.
- **Configurable module definitions** — `"modules"` section in `specsync.json` lets you define module groupings with explicit file lists.
- **Language-specific spec templates** — `generate` and `--fix` produce Swift, Rust, Kotlin/Java, Go, and Python templates with appropriate section headers and table columns.
- **AI context boundary awareness** — generation prompt instructs the provider to only document symbols from the module's own files, not imported dependencies.

### Fixed

- **Test file detection** — expanded Swift patterns (Spec, Mock, Stub, Fake), added Kotlin/Java/C# patterns, and detect well-known test directories (`Tests/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `mocks/`).
- **Check command no longer hangs on empty specs** — returns clean JSON/exit 0 when `--fix` is used with no spec files.
- **Exit code 101 panic → friendly error** — wraps main in `catch_unwind`, converts panics to actionable error messages with bug report link.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- **`--fix` flag for `check` command** — automatically adds undocumented exports as stub rows in the spec's Public API table. Creates a `## Public API` section if one doesn't exist. Works with `--json` for structured output of applied fixes. Turns spec maintenance from manual bookkeeping into a one-command operation.
- **`diff` command** — compares current code exports against a git ref (default: `HEAD`) to show what's been added or removed since a given commit. Human-readable by default, `--json` for structured output. Essential for code review and CI drift detection.
- **Wildcard re-export resolution** — TypeScript/JS barrel files using `export * from './module'` now have their re-exported symbols resolved and validated. Namespace re-exports (`export * as Ns from`) are detected as a single namespace export. Resolution is depth-limited to one level to prevent infinite recursion.

### Changed

- Spec quality scoring now accounts for `--fix` generated stubs (scored lower than hand-written descriptions).
- Expanded integration test suite with 12 new tests covering `--fix`, `diff`, and wildcard re-exports (74 total integration tests, 131 total).
- Updated `cli.spec.md` and `exports.spec.md` to 100% coverage for all new features.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **Rust export extractor** — strip raw strings, char literals with `"`, and multi-line string literals before scanning for `pub` declarations. Fixes false positives from test data inside `r#"..."#` blocks, and false negatives where `'"'` char literals confused the string regex into consuming subsequent source code.
- **CLI spec** — added spec coverage for `main.rs` (CLI entry point).
- **Exports spec** — expanded to 100% file coverage across all language extractors.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added

- **`specsync hooks` command** — manage agent instruction files and git hooks for spec awareness. Supports Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`), Cursor (`.cursor/rules`), GitHub Copilot (`.github/copilot-instructions.md`), pre-commit hooks, and Claude Code hooks. Subcommands: `install`, `uninstall`, `status`.

### Security

- Updated `rustls-webpki` from 0.103.9 → 0.103.10 to fix RUSTSEC-2025-0016 (CRL Distribution Point matching logic).

### Fixed

- Spec scoring now distinguishes placeholder TODOs from descriptive references (#37).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-20

### Breaking Changes

- **`--ai` flag removed** — replaced by `--provider auto|claude|openai|ollama`. Use `specsync generate --provider auto` for auto-detection, or `--provider claude` for a specific provider. Plain `specsync generate` remains template-only.

### Added

- **Cross-project spec references** — specs can now reference modules in other repos via `cross_project_refs` in config. Validated locally with `specsync check`, verified remotely with `specsync resolve --remote`.
- **Companion files** — associate non-code files (migrations, configs, protos) with spec modules via `companion_files` config.
- **Spec registry** — `specsync registry` reads `specsync-registry.toml` to list and discover specs across a project.
- **`specsync resolve`** — new command to resolve cross-project references. `--remote` flag opt-in fetches registry files from GitHub repos.
- **Project scope definition** — `SCOPE.md` explicitly defines what spec-sync does and doesn't do.

### Changed

- Unified AI provider selection under `--provider` flag with auto-detection support.
- Remote ref verification groups HTTP requests by repo to minimize fetches.
- Updated all docs, examples, and tests for the new CLI surface.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **MCP server mode** — run `specsync mcp` to expose spec-sync as a Model Context Protocol server, enabling any AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.) to validate specs, check coverage, and generate specs via tool calls.
- **Direct API support** for Anthropic and OpenAI — `specsync generate --provider anthropic|openai` can call Claude or GPT APIs directly, no CLI wrapper needed. Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **Auto-detect source directories** — spec-sync now automatically discovers `src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, and other common source directories, so it works out-of-the-box on any project without manual config.
- **Spec quality scoring** — `specsync score` rates spec files on completeness, API coverage, section depth, and staleness, outputting a 0–100 quality score with actionable improvement suggestions.
- **TOML configuration** — `specsync.toml` is now supported alongside `specsync.json`. See `examples/specsync.toml`.
- **VS Code extension scaffold** — `vscode-extension/` directory with diagnostics, commands, and CodeLens integration (ready for Marketplace packaging).
- **Actionable error messages** — all errors and warnings now include fix suggestions.
- Expanded integration test suite (+884 lines).

### Fixed

- Resolved clippy and fmt CI failures on main (#29).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added

- **`specsync generate --ai`** — AI-powered spec generation. Reads source code, sends it to an LLM, and generates specs with real content (Purpose, Public API tables, Invariants, Error Cases) instead of template stubs. Configurable via `aiCommand` and `aiTimeout` in `specsync.json`, or `SPECSYNC_AI_COMMAND` env var. Defaults to Claude CLI, works with any LLM that reads stdin and writes stdout.
- **LOC coverage tracking** — `specsync coverage` now reports lines-of-code coverage alongside file coverage. JSON output includes `loc_coverage`, `loc_covered`, `loc_total`, and `uncovered_files` with per-file LOC counts sorted by size.
- **Flat file module detection** — `generate` and `coverage` now detect single-file modules (e.g., `src/config.rs`) in addition to subdirectory-based modules.
- `aiCommand` and `aiTimeout` config options in `specsync.json`.

### Changed

- Rewrote README for density — every line carries new information, no filler.
- Documented `generate --ai` workflow, AI command configuration, and LOC coverage in README and docs site.
- Streamlined docs site pages to complement rather than duplicate the README.
- Updated CHANGELOG with previously missing 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 entries.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed

- Resolved merge conflict markers in README.md.
- Removed overly broad permissions from CI workflow (code scanning alert fix).

### Changed

- Bumped `Cargo.toml` version to match the release tag.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed

- Corrected GitHub Marketplace link after action rename.
- Renamed action from "SpecSync Check" to "SpecSync" for Marketplace consistency.
- Updated all marketplace URLs to reflect the new action name.

### Added

- GitHub Marketplace badge and link in README.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Reusable GitHub Action** (`CorvidLabs/spec-sync@v1`) — auto-downloads the
  correct platform binary and runs specsync check in CI. Supports `strict`,
  `require-coverage`, `root`, and `version` inputs.
- **`watch` subcommand** — live spec validation that re-runs on file changes.
- **Comprehensive integration test suite** — end-to-end tests using assert_cmd.

### Changed

- Updated crates.io metadata (readme, homepage fields).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **Complete rewrite from TypeScript to Rust** for language-agnostic spec validation
  with significantly improved performance and a single static binary.
- **9 language backends** for export extraction: TypeScript/JavaScript, Rust, Go,
  Python, Swift, Kotlin, Java, C#, and Dart.
- **`check` command** — validates all spec files against source code, checking
  frontmatter, file existence, required sections, API surface coverage,
  DB table references, and dependency specs.
- **`coverage` command** — reports file and module coverage, listing unspecced
  files and modules.
- **`generate` command** — scaffolds spec files for unspecced modules using
  a customizable template (`_template.spec.md`).
- **`init` command** — creates a default `specsync.json` configuration file.
- **`--json` flag** — global CLI flag that outputs results as structured JSON
  instead of colored terminal text, for CI/CD and tooling integration.
- **`--strict` flag** — treats warnings as errors for CI enforcement.
- **`--require-coverage N` flag** — fails if file coverage percent is below
  the given threshold.
- **`--root` flag** — overrides the project root directory.
- **CI/CD workflows** with GitHub Actions for testing, linting, and
  multi-platform release binary publishing (Linux x86_64/aarch64,
  macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows x86_64).
- Configurable required sections, exclude patterns, source extensions,
  and schema table validation via `specsync.json`.
- YAML frontmatter parsing without external YAML dependencies.
- API surface validation: detects undocumented exports (warnings) and
  phantom documentation for non-existent exports (errors).
- Dependency spec cross-referencing and Consumed By section validation.
